# threshold-master

I want an internal app for managing categories. 

The table should list the different categories: catheggory -3 all the way to cathegory 7 (-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2....)

Each cathegory has: 
- A bottom and top  threshold expressed in cost (create random values for these thresholds)
- Portions size (select between size 1, size 2.... all theway to 6) 
- Company (select between between Adam Mattkasse, Godlevert, Linas)
- Sales price (use random values here)

The user should be able to create, update and delete the categories. Make sure I can take all the above actions. 

follow the  design principles:
**Color Scheme:**
- The app will have a light base with a predominantly white background to create a clean and expansive feel.
- Vibrant colors like a bright blue will be used for highlighting important features and buttons to draw attention.
- Black and grey will be used for text for clarity.

**Layout and Structure:**
- The app will have a simple, top-aligned navigation bar with clear categories for easy access.
- The footer design will be minimal with essential links organized into categories for easy navigation.
- Content will be organized using card layouts and distinct sections for neat and logical information arrangement.
- Consistent margins and padding will be applied to maintain a structured, airy layout throughout the app.

**Typography:**
- Varied type sizes and weights will be used to establish a clear visual hierarchy for easy navigation.
- Clean, sans-serif fonts will be selected for body text for enhanced legibility and a modern appeal.
- Color will be used strategically in text to highlight important information or calls to action.

**Interactive Elements:**
- Call-to-action buttons will have standout colors that contrast with the background for easy location.
- Subtle hover effects will be used to indicate interactivity without overwhelming the user experience.
- All interactive elements will be designed to be accessible, with adequate size
